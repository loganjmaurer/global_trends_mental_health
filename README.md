An Analysis of the Prevalence of Psychiatric Conditions in Different Countries Across Time

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder/data

This dataset shows the prevalence of seven mental health conditions in most countries for the years 1990 to 2017.
What I have now is a set of side by side plots for each mental health condition that shows a global average for the prevalence of that condition across time.

I am working on clustering the countries by similarity in the prevalence of these conditions.
